Hi and welcome to my blog, where I post random stuff that I deal with during my work as a technical editor in a software company.

### My Role

As mentioned above, I work as a technical editor at a software company.
When I started this job in 2021, I was a career changer (former application engineer). 
While I had some experience writing software documentation, I wasn't trained in the field of writing / documenting.
Furthermore, I was hired to take over the work of my colleague - an actual technical editor - who started her 2-year parental leave about two weeks before my first day at the company. For these 2 years I was the only technical editor in the company and responsible for all aspects of the documentation, including gathering all kinds of information, optimizing (shortening) the publishing process and writing documentation alongside our agile software developer team.
